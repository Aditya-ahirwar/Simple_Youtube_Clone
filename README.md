# Simple YouTube Clone
This is a simplified YouTube clone that fetches videos from an API and allows users to watch them.

## Steps to Install and Run

 Clone the repository using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Aditya-ahirwar/Simple_Youtube_Clone.git`

Install all the dependencies by running:
`npm i`

 Start the application on the local host:
`npm run start`

 On the home page, click on any video thumbnail to open that video. Then, click anywhere on the video to start playing it.

 The API is paginated, with each request returning 10 videos. To fetch new videos, use the 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons.
